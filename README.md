Class 8 - Prompt 204
Describe one thing you're learning in class today.
Today I have read about the difference between mutable and immutable variables

Can you describe the main difference between a forEach loop and a .map() loop and why you would pick one versus the other?
Describe event bubbling.
forEach changes all of the objects in an array while .map() returns the objects that meet the criteria 


What is the definition of a higher-order function?
It takes one or more functions as an arguement as opposed to a variable

What Is an associative array in JavaScript?
an abstract data type that stores a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection. 

Why should you never use new Array in JavaScript?
returns undefined


Class 10 - Prompt 205
Describe one thing you're learning in class today. Why do you think it will be important in your future web development journey?
We are learning object oriented programming which is important because it helps to change and organize data when there is a lot of it.

Can you offer a use case for the new arrow => function syntax?
I dont understand the question. I know a function would look like this:
let function = (data) => {
return data * 2 }

How does this new syntax differ from the older function signature, function nameFunc(){}, both in style and functionality?
It does not change the functionality but makes it more readible

Explain the differences on the usage of foo between function foo() {} and const foo = function() {}
They are the same but formatted differently

What advantage is there for using the arrow syntax for a method in a constructor?
Arrow syntax binds this to the surrounding code which makes the code simpler and shorter.

Can you give an example for destructuring an object or an array?
.pop()

Class 12 - Prompt 206
Tell us about something you learned this week.
We discussed algorithems 
What are the pros and cons of immutability?
It keeps your code bug free but less functionality 

How can you achieve immutability in your own code?
use const in stead of let

What are Divide and Conquer algorithms? Describe how they work. Can you give any common examples of the types of problems where this approach might be used?
This involves dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems

How do insertion sort, heap sort, quick sort, and merge sort work?
Merge Sort-  If n value is large, it follows divide and conquer approach.
Insertion sort- The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
Heap Sort - bubble sorting. compares two then two more etc

Explain the difference between mutable and immutable objects.
can be vs cannot be changed

What are the three laws of algorithm recursion? Describe them in your own words and what they mean to you.
 A recursive algorithm must have a base case. A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case. A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.

Class 14 - Prompt 207
Write about something you learned this week.
We learned about how to fetch API's and promises

Why would you use something like the load event? Does this event have disadvantages? Do you know any alternatives, and why would you use those?
When you need random numbers or already collected data

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Ajax?

Explain how JSONP works (and how it's not really Ajax).

Explain Ajax in as much detail as possible.

What does it mean when we talk about time complexity of an algorithm?

What are the three laws of algorithm recursion?

How do you see yourself growing as a web developer?


Class 16 - Prompt 208
Talk about something you learned this week.
Explain Function.prototype.bind()
Describe event bubbling.
What's the difference between the window load event and document DOMContentLoaded event?
Describe the call stack.
